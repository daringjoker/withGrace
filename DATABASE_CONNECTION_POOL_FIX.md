# Database Connection Pool Timeout Fix Guide

## Problem
You're seeing the error: "timed out fetching new connection from connection pool"

## Root Causes
1. **Connection Pool Exhaustion**: Too many concurrent requests for available connections
2. **Long-Running Queries**: Database operations taking longer than expected
3. **Connection Leaks**: Connections not being properly released back to the pool
4. **Insufficient Pool Size**: Default pool size (10) too small for your application load

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Database Connection Management
- ✅ Added proper error handling with connection timeout detection
- ✅ Enhanced logging to identify connection pool issues
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling to prevent connection leaks

### 2. Optimized Prisma Configuration
- ✅ Enhanced connection pool settings in `src/lib/prisma.ts`
- ✅ Proper global instance management to prevent multiple clients
- ✅ Development health checks to monitor connection status

### 3. Database URL Optimization
Update your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable with these parameters:

```bash
# Add these query parameters to your existing DATABASE_URL:
DATABASE_URL="your_current_url?connection_limit=20&pool_timeout=20&connect_timeout=20&socket_timeout=20"
```

**Parameter Explanations:**
- `connection_limit=20`: Increases max connections from default 10 to 20
- `pool_timeout=20`: Wait up to 20 seconds for an available connection
- `connect_timeout=20`: Wait up to 20 seconds to establish new connection
- `socket_timeout=20`: Socket operation timeout of 20 seconds

### 4. API Route Enhancements
- ✅ Better error handling with specific timeout detection
- ✅ Improved logging for debugging connection issues
- ✅ Development mode error details for troubleshooting

## Testing the Fix

1. **Update your DATABASE_URL** with the optimized parameters
2. **Restart your development server**
3. **Monitor the logs** for connection-related messages
4. **Test with concurrent requests** to verify pool management

## Monitoring

Watch for these log messages that indicate the fix is working:
- ✅ No more "timed out fetching new connection" errors
- ✅ Proper error handling with connection pool timeout detection
- ✅ Health check messages in development mode

## If Problems Persist

1. **Check your database server capacity**
2. **Monitor concurrent request patterns**
3. **Consider increasing `connection_limit` further (30-50 for high load)**
4. **Verify database server connection limits**

## Production Considerations

For production deployment:
- Use connection pooling at the database server level
- Consider connection limits based on your hosting provider
- Monitor database performance metrics
- Set up proper database monitoring and alerts
